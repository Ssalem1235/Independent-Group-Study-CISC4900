# Quantifying the Societal and Environmental Impact of Artificial Intelligence

## Overview
This project investigates how the rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) affects human society and the environment. Using publicly available, reputable datasets, we conduct a data-driven analysis of AI adoption trends, societal impact indicators, and energy consumption associated with AI-driven data centers. The project combines research methodology with computational analysis, data visualization, and reproducible workflows.

The goal of this project is not to claim direct causation, but to provide measurable, evidence-based insights into the broader implications of AI growth using real-world data.

## Research Questions
- How has AI adoption grown across recent years, and how widespread is AI exposure?
- What measurable societal indicators are associated with increased AI adoption?
- What are the environmental and energy implications of AI-driven data centers?
- How might continued AI growth impact society and sustainability in the future?

## Project Timeline & Methodology

### Phase 1 — Project Planning & Literature Review (Weeks 1–2)
- Define research scope and key questions
- Review academic and industry literature on:
  - AI adoption and exposure
  - Societal and social-interaction impacts
  - Environmental and energy implications of AI
- Identify and evaluate public data sources
- Set up GitHub repository and collaboration workflow

**Deliverables:**
- Finalized project scope
- Annotated bibliography
- Initial repository structure

---

### Phase 2 — Data Acquisition & Preprocessing (Weeks 3–4)
- Collect quantitative datasets related to:
  - AI adoption and growth metrics
  - Public attitudes and societal indicators
  - AI-related data center electricity consumption
- Convert reports and tables into structured datasets where necessary
- Clean, normalize, and merge datasets using Python
- Document data sources, assumptions, and limitations

**Deliverables:**
- Cleaned datasets (CSV format)
- Data preprocessing scripts
- Data documentation

---

### Phase 3 — Exploratory Data Analysis (Weeks 5–6)
- Perform descriptive statistical analysis:
  - Trends in AI adoption over time
  - Changes in societal attitudes toward AI
  - Growth in AI-related energy demand
- Generate exploratory visualizations using Python
- Identify notable patterns and shifts (e.g., pre- vs post-2023 trends)

**Deliverables:**
- Exploratory plots and summary statistics
- Initial analytical findings

---

### Phase 4 — Statistical & Comparative Analysis (Weeks 7–8)
- Conduct quantitative analysis including:
  - Correlation analysis between AI adoption and societal indicators
  - Group-based or time-based comparisons
  - Regression or difference-in-differences–style analysis where appropriate
- Interpret results within ethical and methodological limitations

**Deliverables:**
- Statistical analysis results
- Documented analysis notebooks

---

### Phase 5 — Environmental Impact & Scenario Modeling (Weeks 9–10)
- Analyze AI-related data center electricity consumption trends
- Calculate growth rates and projected impacts
- Develop a small-scale scenario model to estimate future environmental implications under varying AI adoption assumptions

**Deliverables:**
- Environmental impact analysis
- Scenario model or simulation outputs

---

### Phase 6 — Visualization & Dashboard Development (Weeks 11–12)
- Build an interactive Tableau dashboard presenting:
  - AI adoption trends
  - Societal impact indicators
  - Environmental and energy consumption metrics
- Ensure clarity, interactivity, and proper data attribution

**Deliverables:**
- Interactive Tableau dashboard
- Dashboard documentation

---

### Phase 7 — Synthesis, Reporting & Presentation (Weeks 13–14)
- Integrate findings into a comprehensive final report
- Discuss societal, ethical, and environmental implications
- Prepare presentation slides and demonstration materials
- Finalize GitHub repository and project website (GitHub Pages)

**Deliverables:**
- Final written report (PDF)
- Presentation slides
- Public project website
- Final GitHub repository

---
